# Push Button

#### Project Overview

The Push Button project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Nano to interface with a push button and monitor its state. Push buttons are simple yet versatile components commonly used for user input in various electronic devices and projects.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Push Button**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Push Button to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect one leg of the push button to a digital pin on the Arduino Nano (e.g., pin 2).
   - Connect the other leg of the push button to GND on the Arduino Nano.
   - Optionally, use a pull-up resistor between the digital pin and 5V to ensure proper signal reading (internal pull-up can also be enabled).

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the push button to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - The serial monitor will display the state of the push button (pressed or not pressed).

#### Applications

- **User Input:** Utilize push buttons as user interface elements for triggering actions or navigating menus in interactive projects.
- **Control Systems:** Incorporate push buttons into control systems for manual input or mode selection.
- **Interrupt Detection:** Use push buttons to trigger interrupt routines for handling specific events or actions.

#### Notes

- Ensure proper debounce mechanisms are implemented to handle contact bounce if necessary.
- Experiment with different pull-up or pull-down resistor configurations based on the specific requirements of your project.
- Consider incorporating push buttons into larger projects involving multiple input devices or control interfaces.
